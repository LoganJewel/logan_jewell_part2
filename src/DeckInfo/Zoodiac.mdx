Within the year of 2017 there were 2 decks that rose to prominice,
during the start of the year Zoodiacs appeared and became one of the
best archetypes to ever exist in the game. The deck focused around
spamming XYZ monster and resource generation. The gimmick specifically,
was instead of needing multiple monster to XYZ summon one of their
archetype cards, a player could use a single Zoodiac to summon any of them.
This allowed for huge resources that could be attacked to an XYZ monster.
This was pushed further with the card "Zoodiac Ratpier" which allowed
an XYZ monster using it as material to detach a card, and summon another
Ratpier from the deck, generating even more XYZ monsters to be summoned,
and more resources. The main boss monsters of the archetype were,
"Zoodiac Broadbull" and "Zoodiac Drident". Where broadbull could
search ANY beast-warrior monster, not just Zoodiacs, and Drident
could destroy cards. The deck was so powerful and versitile, that the
deck could be splashed into so many other decks, due to the massive
resource generation. The deck dominated for a long time, and it took 
completely banning Broadbull, Ratpier, and Drident. Drident was 
eventually limited in later years. To this day the archetype has so
much versatility that it still sees play to this day as an engine starter
for other decks. When it comes to sheer impact, Zoodiac probably had the
largest long standing impact.
