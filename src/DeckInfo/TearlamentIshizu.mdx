The most recent tier 0 deck in the history of Yu-Gi-Oh is Tearlament
-Ishizu. This is the splashing of two milling decks into a arguebly
the most broken deck in the games history. Tearlaments were powerful,
they were insanely consistent, they could summon big boss monsters,
 they could destroy cards, they could negate cards, they could setup
 on the OPPONENTS turn, and everything the either player would do, would
 result in the opponent having their deck milled(Cards from the deck
 get removed from play, so basically it starves resources). Tearlaments
 were already scary, but they were managable, and for a while Sprights were
 more powerful. Why are they being discussed here? Well that answer
 to that question requires a history lesson. Ishizus were an archetype
 that originated from the anime, they were an archtype belonging to a character
 that goes by the same name as the archetype. The cards, were awful,
 they had no use whatsoever and were more of a hinderance run than play 
 against. In 2022, the deck's cards got retrains(Basically remakes with new
 effects), and they were hellish nightmares. Remember how Tearlaments
 could mill the opponent? Well now with Ishizus, the milled cards 
 triple in quantity, and they can recycle resources, so Tearlaments
 can have their resources refreshed. Ishizus turned Tearlaments from 
 an almost tier 0 deck, to a deck so broken that many argue it is
 the most powerful deck in the games history. The deck was so powerful,
 that both archetypes were almost completely banned, and the cards that
 were not were heavily limited, effectively removing the decks from
 existance. It is worth noting that Tearlament Ishizu is also the
 first Tier 0 deck in Master Duel, and they are arguably even
 more powerful in this games format than either the TCG or OCG.
 In the TCG and OCG games go off a best 3 format, where side decks
 can have cards to be added to the main decks to counter other decks.
 Master Duel is a best of 1 format, so if the counter cards are not in the
 main deck, a player will just lost more often than not, and to make
 matters worse, Tearlament Ishizu was released at full power into the game.
 This is where the story of Tearlament Ishizu is at currently, a 
 deck of nightmares sent to the Shadow Realm in the TCG and OCG,
 then clawed its way out of the abyss with a vengence in Master Duel.
