2013 saw the introduction of one of the single most broken archetypes
within the games history. Dragon Rulers, a series of level 7 Dragon 
monsters of varying attributes. The archetype was less intended to be
its own deck, and more support for the different attributes. The opposite
occurred, and it was sheer terror. The deck completely and utterly dominated,
there was no other deck that came before it that could match it. 
Other decks in the meta were either some variant of Dragon Rulers,
or they were designed to specifically check Dragon Rulers. Notice
the wording, "Check," not "Counter," as the deck had absolutely none.
The deck is often described as a 2019 onward era deck that released,
in 2013, and that the description could not be more perfect for the deck.
The deck comprised 4 "Baby" dragons, and 4 "Daddy" dragons. Where
the babies helped the daddy dragons get on the field. These cards
allowed a player to discard a MOUNTAIN of cards, to get a variety of
effects and bonuses. Discarding may sound bad, but in Yu-Gi-Oh, the
graveyard is basically a second hand depending on the deck being ran.
It was sheer nightmare fuel. The deck would dominate and basically be
a tier 0 deck, where it only missed the title because another tier 0 deck
rose to prominince at the time, it was the only deck that could actually
fight dragon rulers, and it was Spellbooks. Dragon Rulers eventually,
were annihilated as an archetype by the ban list. With literally all of them
getting banned, and only recently a few have been made limited, not
completely banned, but mostly banned.
