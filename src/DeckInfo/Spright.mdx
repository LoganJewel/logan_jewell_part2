In 2022, Sprights rose to dominate the meta for very similar reasons
to that of SPYRALS. That would be due to consistency by search ability,
resource generation, and the fact they were level 2 monsters. Them being level 2
gave them access to a ton of other cards that could be splashed into the deck,
with the most prevalent being frogs. Frogs have had a variety of uses over the
years, but here their focus is resource generation, and the king of the
archetype, "Toadally Awesome." This card is an omni-negate that can return
to the extra when it is destroyed. Sprights were powerful, but with
Toad they were pushed over the edge and they went from tier 1, to 
tier 0. They only fell down when important staples like "Spright Elf"
and "Ronintoadin" where banned, which gutted their resource generation.
Funnily enough, they are sort of the inverice of SPYRALS in where they
rose to tier 0. As while SPYRALS rose in the TCG exclusively, Sprights
rose to tier 0 in the OCG.
