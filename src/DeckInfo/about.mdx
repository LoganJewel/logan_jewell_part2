Within different forms of media, people will often rank something
based on a variety of factors such as: How good is it, how bad is
it, etc. Within the card game Yu-Gi-Oh the card game has a tiering
system to rank playable decks within the variety of formats. 
Decks are ranked from bottom tier(Terrible decks that one should
avoid playing), rogue decks(Decks that are not amazing in the
format, but still have use and can succeed), tier 3 decks(Solid 
decks that are just good), tier 2(Great decks), tier 1(Top tier
decks), and the nightmare that are Tier 0 decks. Tier 0 decks 
are nightmarish decks that are so powerful they defined their 
formats to the point of being banned. Technically speaking a
deck is Tier 0 when they comprised over 65% of representation within
the cut of deck placements within major tournaments. The decks that 
can be viewed on the appropriate page shall include decks that 
technically were not Tier 0, but they are considered such as they
would have been if they were not banned so quickly. 
The standard formats are the TCG, the OCG, and Master Duel. They 
all have differences, but they also have a lot of similarities as 
well, particularly with their decks that have risen to the heights 
of Tier 0. If you would like to learn about specific Tier 0 Decks, 
please go to "TheDecks" page.
