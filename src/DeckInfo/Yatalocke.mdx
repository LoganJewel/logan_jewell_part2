The early days of Yu-Gi-Oh did not actually have a tiering system per say.
There were powerful cards, but specific decks didn't really overly dominate
at the time. That all changed however in 2004, with the domination of
Yatalocke, which was the very first deck to ever be considered a Tier 0 deck.
The deck made a heavy use of a collection of big boss monsters that 
were fairly easy to summon when in comparison to other big boss monsters
at the time. Specifically the cards,"Black Luster Soldier" -Envoy Of The
Beginning"(BLS), and "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy Of The End"(CED).
BLS was just a strong boss monster that was easy to get out at the time,
while CED was a main focus of the deck as it allowed for the player 
summoning it to completely nuke both boards. Then, if the player 
had a card like Sangan to add 1 monster with 1500 or less ATK from
their deck to their hand, they could add Yata-Garasu. This deck
is called the Yatalocke because Yata-Garasu would prevent the opponent
from drawing cards when they were attacked. If this combo was done correctly,
a player could be effectively preventing from drawing cards for the
rest of the game. Needless to say, this was so oppresive that the 
first Forbidden list for the game was created and the deck was 
effectively banned.
