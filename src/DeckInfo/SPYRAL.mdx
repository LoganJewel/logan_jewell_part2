SPYRAL was one of the other tier 0 decks that rose to the top of play
in 2017. SPYRAL is interesting as it is the only TCG exclusive tier 0
format deck, as the archetype never was released in the OCG. The deck
started off in the TCG as being solid, roughly tier 2, but as time
went on it became a monster of an archetype. This occurred with the
release of "SPYRAL Double Helix" allowed for easy access for "SPYRAL
Master Plan", which was able to get out the entire archetype. What 
made this deck broken was the consistency was, completely consistent 
because of Double Helix getting out Master Plan. In fact, there
had never been a deck such consistency in the history of the game
prior. The deck could generate insane resources with little trouble,
and those resources could be used to get out big boss monsters that 
could lock down the oppnent's board and basically control the game.
