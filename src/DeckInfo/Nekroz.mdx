Nekroz rose within the year of 2015, where it essentially revitalized
the Ritual Summoning mechanic of the game, by stabbing it with an 
insane amount of steroids. The deck focused on discarding themselves
to do a variety of effects. They could get more cards for the player,
starve the opponent of their resources, they were easy to summon, and 
they hit like trucks. The cards were pushed to god hood when people
started running "Djinn Releaser of Rituals" which made it too where
if that card was used in the Ritual summon of a monster. The opponent
could not do any form of special summoning what so ever. Needless to say,
if this was setup the game was pretty much over, since the vast 
majority of decks are special summoning focused. The deck was 
evicerated by the Forbidden list where Djinn would be banned, 
and its staple cards being all limited.
