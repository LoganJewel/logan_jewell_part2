This deck started popping up around 2008, and it was focused around
the boss monster "Dark Armed Dragon"(DAD). DAD was a card that could
be special summoned if there were exactly 3 Dark monsters in the 
graveyard. There were plenty of easy ways to get Dark monsters in
the graveyard, so that restriction was hardly a problem. One may
assume that DAD was just good because it was a big boss monster because
it was easy to summon, which is part of the reason, however, its 
effect is what sent the card over the edge. A Dark monster can be sent
to the banished zone from the graveyard to destroy a card on the field.
What made this oppresive? It wasn't once per turn, so effectively,
the DAD player could pop the oppnents entire board, and replenish
the graveyard even more to keep popping cards. The deck would
eventually fall out of favor due to new rising decks in the format
that knocked it down. That was until the introduction of Synchro monsters
where DAD into a nightmarish deck. This was due to its already mentioned
upsides, plus the introduction of the card "Emergency Teleport", which
allowed one to special summon psychic monsters to the field. At the
time most psychic monsters where dark types, and when monsters are
used to synchro summoned they are sent to the graveyard, see where
this is going? It allowed for DAD to be brought even easier before,
couple that with other cards that allow a player to control the game,
and the deck of Tele-DAD rose to Tier 0. The deck was eventually
nerfed heavily by core cards being limited and new decks coming
to the forefront.
