This was a deck that rose to prominince in 2013 not terribly long after
Dragon Rulers ran the show. They were the only deck in the format that
could consistently beat Dragon Rulers. Spellbooks were not around for 
terribly long, but their impact was massive. They were a very consistent
deck, that had an extremely easy time searching out its pieces.
They were heavily used in strategies that locked the opponent out of 
banishing cards and special summoning. Since the deck also had a heavy
focus on spell cards searching each other out, they were fantastic
when paired with archetypes that focused on the use of spell counters.
Most spell counters provided one the ability to draw more, destroy a card,
or negate effects. This effectively made spellbooks even more consistent,
while giving them control, and board popping capabilities. They were
only not tier 0 because Dragon Rulers were around at the time, splitting
representation.
