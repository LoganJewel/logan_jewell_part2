Performage Plush/Performpal(PEPE) was another deck that rose to
prominince within 2015 alongside Nekroz. It was a pendulum summoning
deck that took a while before players found how powerful the deck actually was.
The deck was able to summon armies of monsters, and it was insanely
consistent. It had countless ways to search for all of the cards within the
archetype. It could create resources for big boss monsters that most
decks would struggle to get out. It had a mountain of protection for the player,
the backrow, and the monsters. The deck had literally everything, one
could think of. The sad part of all of this however is the deck, rose 
to prominince at the single worst time it could have been, as a Forbidden
list was coming soon anyway. The deck was added to the list as an Emergency
addition to the list. The deck was only considered the power of tier 0
for 5 days. Which is both calming, and kind of sad.
